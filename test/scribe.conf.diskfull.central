## Sample Scribe configuration
##

# This file configures Scribe to listen for messages on port 1463 and write
# them to /tmp/scribetest
#
# This configuration also tells Scribe to discard messages with a category
# that begins with 'ignore'.
#
# If the message category is 'bucket_me', Scribe will hash this message to
# 1 of 5 buckets.
